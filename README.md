# Flashcards
This webpage features cards with country names on them and when hovering over one, the card will flip in a 3D animation to display the country's capital city on its back. The purpose of this project was to learn creating the 3D flip animation. This project was done as part of the "Frontend Developer" course on Hyperskill.
